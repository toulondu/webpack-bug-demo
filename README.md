### steps to start app:

- run `yarn`
- run `yarn run install-all`
- run `yarn start` to start all apps.
- visit [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) to see the result.

There are three apps, a main micro frontend app and two child app(one use webpack-4 and the other is webpack-5).

You can see the webpack4 app works and the webpack5 app failed.

PS: use port 3001,3002,3003
